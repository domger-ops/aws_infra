# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.
## NOTE: While this is normally best practice it allows for configurations to be lost
## Larger orgs have dedicated secret stores but for cost purposes we keep our none secret envs
## plaintext and encrypt senestive files using SOPs/KMS allowing us to store all these configs in a repo securely

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
